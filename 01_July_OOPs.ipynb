        "**What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans)The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to improve the manageability, modularity, reusability, and understandability of code by organizing it around the concept of \"objects.\" These objects are meant to represent entities in the real world or in the problem domain, encapsulating both data and behavior (functions or methods) related to that entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation**: This involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. This also provides mechanisms to restrict access to certain components, ensuring that internal details are hidden from the outside, which leads to safer and more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance**: This allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, promoting the reuse of code and establishing a natural hierarchy between classes. It facilitates the creation of a new class based on an existing one, with the possibility of adding or overriding certain behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism**: This means \"many shapes\" and in OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. This is especially powerful when combined with inheritance, as it allows for flexibility and reuse, as well as more intuitive interfaces in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction**: Abstraction allows for modeling complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts and focusing only on the relevant details. In OOP, this is achieved by defining classes and their interfaces in a way that represents the essential characteristics of the problem domain while ignoring the non-essential details."
